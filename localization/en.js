Essentially, your private key is a really large number (that can be represented with a 12 word sequence or a QR code). This number gets multiplied by another that everyone knows (called a base point) and we get a public key. When you enter your private key, we can multiply it by the base point to get your public key and we can match it against public address. If they match, we know it is you. It is impossible to go back i.e. to divide public key by the base point to get your private key. The way multiplication in cryptography works is it is only one way and cannot be reversed, so your key is safe. "+appname+" uses the same exact cryptography as Bitcoin."

Advertisers will be able to easily find content authors with the right audience and then offer them advertising opportunities. This will be a trustless endeavor (i.e. neither side can cheat), because of something called multi-signature contracts. Multisig contract requires a digital signature of both parties to be valid. When advertiser offers an ad to the content creator, he creates the first of two required signatures. He signs the actual ad and the amount bid. Content creator reviews this partially signed multisig and if it is accepted, then he appends the second signature. When a blockchain sees both signatures, content creator is automatically paid and an ad is automatically shown on creator’s channel. These transactions will only be done through Pocketcoin. Thus, if Pocketcoin becomes big, it will be an immensely valuable token."
