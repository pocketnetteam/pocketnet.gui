Sometimes it's called a \"filter\",\r\n// but that's not a great name for it, since that implies a thing where\r\n// some bits pass through, and others are simply ignored.  (That would\r\n// be a valid example of a transform, of course.)\r\n//\r\n// While the output is causally related to the input, it's not a\r\n// necessarily symmetric or synchronous transformation.  For example,\r\n// a zlib stream might take multiple plain-text writes(), and then\r\n// emit a single compressed chunk some time in the future.\r\n//\r\n// Here's how this works:\r\n//\r\n// The Transform stream has all the aspects of the readable and writable\r\n// stream classes.  When you write(chunk), that calls _write(chunk,cb)\r\n// internally, and returns false if there's a lot of pending writes\r\n// buffered up.  When you call read(), that calls _read(n) until\r\n// there's enough pending readable data buffered up.\r\n//\r\n// In a transform stream, the written data is placed in a buffer.  When\r\n// _read(n) is called, it transforms the queued up data, calling the\r\n// buffered _write cb's as it consumes chunks.  If consuming a single\r\n// written chunk would result in multiple output chunks, then the first\r\n// outputted bit calls the readcb, and subsequent chunks just go into\r\n// the read buffer, and will cause it to emit 'readable' if necessary.\r\n//\r\n// This way, back-pressure is actually determined by the reading side,\r\n// since _read has to be called to start processing a new chunk.  However,\r\n// a pathological inflate type of transform can cause excessive buffering\r\n// here.  For example, imagine a stream where every byte of input is\r\n// interpreted as an integer from 0-255, and then results in that many\r\n// bytes of output.  Writing the 4 bytes {ff,ff,ff,ff} would result in\r\n// 1kb of data being output.  In this case, you could write a very small\r\n// amount of input, and end up with a very large amount of output.  In\r\n// such a pathological inflating mechanism, there'd be no way to tell\r\n// the system to stop doing the transform.  A single 4MB write could\r\n// cause the system to run out of memory.\r\n//\r\n// However, even in such a pathological case, only a single written chunk\r\n// would be consumed, and then the rest would wait (un-transformed) until\r\n// the results of the previous transformed chunk were consumed.\r\n\r\n'use strict';\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = Transform;\r\n\r\nvar Duplex = require('./_stream_duplex');\r\n\r\n/*<replacement>*/\r\nvar util = require('core-util-is');\r\nutil.inherits = require('inherits');\r\n/*</replacement>*/\r\n\r\nutil.inherits(Transform, Duplex);\r\n\r\nfunction afterTransform(er, data) {\r\n  var ts = this._transformState;\r\n  ts.transforming = false;\r\n\r\n  var cb = ts.writecb;\r\n\r\n  if (!cb) {\r\n    return this.emit('error', new Error('write callback called multiple times'));\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  ts.writechunk = null;\r\n  ts.writecb = null;\r\n\r\n  if (data != null) // single equals check for both `null` and `undefined`\r\n    this.push(data);\r\n\r\n  cb(er);\r\n\r\n  var rs = this._readableState;\r\n  rs.reading = false;\r\n  if (rs.needReadable || rs.length < rs.highWaterMark) {\r\n    this._read(rs.highWaterMark);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction Transform(options) {\r\n  if (!(this instanceof Transform)) return new Transform(options);\r\n\r\n  Duplex.call(this, options);\r\n\r\n  this._transformState = {\r\n    afterTransform: afterTransform.bind(this),\r\n    needTransform: false,\r\n    transforming: false,\r\n    writecb: null,\r\n    writechunk: null,\r\n    writeencoding: null\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  // start out asking for a readable event once data is transformed.\r\n  this._readableState.needReadable = true;\r\n\r\n  // we have implemented the _read method, and done the other things\r\n  // that Readable wants before the first _read call, so unset the\r\n  // sync guard flag.\r\n  this._readableState.sync = false;\r\n\r\n  if (options) {\r\n    if (typeof options.transform === 'function') this._transform = options.transform;\r\n\r\n    if (typeof options.flush === 'function') this._flush = options.flush;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  // When the writable side finishes, then flush out anything remaining.\r\n  this.on('prefinish', prefinish);\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction prefinish() {\r\n  var _this = this;\r\n\r\n  if (typeof this._flush === 'function') {\r\n    this._flush(function (er, data) {\r\n      done(_this, er, data);\r\n    });\r\n  } else {\r\n    done(this, null, null);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nTransform.prototype.push = function (chunk, encoding) {\r\n  this._transformState.needTransform = false;\r\n  return Duplex.prototype.push.call(this, chunk, encoding);\r\n};\r\n\r\n// This is the part where you do stuff!\r\n// override this function in implementation classes.\r\n// 'chunk' is an input chunk.\r\n//\r\n// Call `push(newChunk)` to pass along transformed output\r\n// to the readable side.
