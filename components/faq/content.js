Essentially, your private key is a really large number (that can be represented with a 12 word sequence or a QR code). This number gets multiplied by another that everyone knows (called a base point) and we get a public key. When you enter your private key, we can multiply it by the base point to get your public key and we can match it against public address. If they match, we know it is you. It is impossible to go back i.e. to divide public key by the base point to get your private key. The way multiplication in cryptography works is it is only one way and cannot be reversed, so your key is safe. Pocketnet uses the same exact cryptography as Bitcoin.</div>',

Advertisers will be able to easily find content authors with the right audience and then offer them advertising opportunities. This will be a trustless endeavor (i.e. neither side can cheat), because of something called multi-signature contracts. Multisig contract requires a digital signature of both parties to be valid. When advertiser offers an ad to the content creator, he creates the first of two required signatures. He signs the actual ad and the amount bid. Content creator reviews this partially signed multisig and if it is accepted, then he appends the second signature. When a blockchain sees both signatures, content creator is automatically paid and an ad is automatically shown on creatorâ€™s channel. These transactions will only be done through Pocketcoin. Thus, if Pocketcoin becomes big, it will be an immensely valuable token.</div>',

In addition, Pocketnet will include a marketplace where goods and services will be sold directly for Pocketcoin</div>',

So, by buying a Pocketcoin you are positioning yourself for success of Pocketnet, but just as importantly you are helping Pocketnet achieve this success. All major social networks had billion dollar advertising budgets. Pocketnet was funded by its founders and developers worked only for Pocketcoin. We need you to help us spread the word. To go the extra mile consider buying some Pocketcoin to help us advertise the site. To buy Pocketcoin you will need to first buy Bitcoin or some other cryptocurrency, which is exceedingly easy now.</div>',

Complain is completed when number of complaints is at least â…“ of the number of 4 and 5 star ratings, subject to a minimum of 10 complaints (which will be adjusted over time in consultation with the community).</div><div>We are extremely and passionately pro-speech. However, we do not want to turn Pocketnet into a marginal forum where lunatics reign. What would cause you to Complain?</div><div>Do NOT complain about stuff that you simply donâ€™t like or that offends you. That is not a high enough bar. Do not follow people who offend you, soon we will have a feature for not seeing their posts, but do not complain about them. Complain only about things that threaten long term viability of Pocketnet as a mass communication platform that intends to reach to all levels of society in many countries.</div><div>We strongly recommend that you complain about porn/nudity of any kind. There are plenty of porn/nudity sites on the web, we do not want to mix our free speech endeavor with that. We strongly encourage the community to vote off porn/nudity. Secondly, any type of a direct threat should be voted off and clear examples of racism should too. If we allow MSM to tie us to racism or violence directly, Pocketnet will cease to exist before we can even get it out there. Just because MSM media cries wolf about fake racism, doesnâ€™t mean we should prove them right by tolerating it in our platform. It will detract from what we are trying to achieve, which is to challenge new totalitarianism created by the unholy alliance of media, finance and corrupt government officials.</div> ',

We need to speak the truth and this platform is non-corporate and decentralized for that very reason. But we ask everyone make your point without attacking people&rsquo;s nationality or race. You can make your point based on evidence. We cannot afford to turn Pocketnet into a marginal platform. Speak the truth, but please avoid racism and attacks against specific nationalities on the whole. We know that Silicon Valley and MSM has turned the issue of racism into their playing card and they constantly cry wolf. Even more the reason for us to be measured and evidence based and not let them smear us with that. If we are not, we are not allowing most of the population to weigh the evidence of MSM corruption presented on Pocketnet. Please keep that in mind, so that free speech can thrive and we can beat the facebokks of the world.</div><div>Ultimately, it is the community that will determine the direction of the platform. Having a bunch of snowflakes that complain about stuff that offends them is equally as bad as when people want to voice direct violent threats. However, the first indication is that early users of the platform are generally intelligent and evidence based, so the future looks incredibly bright. Pocketnet team has noticed after a few days of the beta test, that we stopped reading even alternative news, because there was so much interesting content on Pocketnet. Keep it up!</div><div>Please get involved in the discussion on these topics. This is a community platform. We are always eager to improve transparency of the platform and you should let us know how we can improve our content curation and policing.
