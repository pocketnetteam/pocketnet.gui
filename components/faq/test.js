                a : '<div><p>' +self.app.meta.fullname+' is an innovative social network and video sharing platform. Unlike the mainstream social networks, it is not ruled by a company. It is an open source project run by a team of developers and experts, and its scope is to provide a censorship-free platform where the freedom of speech is seriously respected.&nbsp;</p><p>The project was created by&nbsp;Daniel Satchkov and is a decentralized social media platform without any central authority. The platform does not run on a single server but on a network of <em>nodes</em> that are located all throughout the world.&nbsp;</p><p>This means, in practical terms, that users are always able to connect to it, see the content and post as long as they have an internet connection.</p><p>This overcomes the limitations that some governments put in place to block or limit the use of social medias. While for example in China some social networks can be used only behind a VPN, there is no need for that with '+self.app.meta.fullname+'.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition,&nbsp;'+self.app.meta.fullname+' grants complete anonymity: users register without any email or phone number and no personal data like the IP or MAC address are stored in any way.&nbsp;</p><p>By doing so,&nbsp;'+self.app.meta.fullname+' removes the chance for governments to track specific users and to associate an identity to users. Today, anonymity is a requirement for security and privacy and&nbsp;'+self.app.meta.fullname+' is able to guarantee it.&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, in order to deliver completely private and anonymous communication,&nbsp;'+self.app.meta.fullname+' provides an encrypted chat system, not associated to any phone number or personal data, protected with 1 to 1 encryption model. No one except the two persons involved in the chat session can access the messages and governments have no way to look into the database since the communication is encrypted and there are no backdoors and no "master keys" that can be used for decryption. Moreover, all the chat messages are automatically deleted after 7 day.</p><p>'+self.app.meta.fullname+' wants to deliver a completly free, safe and anonymous social platform where people can chat, communicate and share contents without the risk of being controlled, limited or censored by governments or corporations.</p></div>',
