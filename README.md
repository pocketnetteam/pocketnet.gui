# What is Bastyon?

[Bastyon](https://pocketnet.app/about) is a decentralized social network based on the blockchain. The cryptocurrency used by this blockchain is Pocketcoin (**PKOIN**).

There is no central authority or corporation behind Bastyon. The platform is run by equal
nodes on a blockchain with no centralized server. All the revenue generated by the nodes is split
between node operators and content creators. 

Node operators stake Pocketcoin in order to mint blocks with rewards and transactions fees. Half of rewards in each block go to content creators based on ratings their content gathers
from users. [Read more in the article.](https://bastyon.com/docs/Pocketnet%20Whitepaper%20Draft%20v2.pdf)

# What should I know?
The "Pocketnet GUI" software is the Social Network application for end users. It allows you to participate in the network. You can view, create and moderate content, communicate with other network participants and earn PKOIN with your activity. - [Help center `https://bastyon.com/help`](https://pocketnet.app/help?page=faq).

# Usage
At the moment, users can connect to the social network in three ways:
- From the official Website [https://bastyon.com/](https://bastyon.com/)
- Using the Desktop application [https://github.com/pocketnetteam/pocketnet.gui/releases/latest](https://github.com/pocketnetteam/pocketnet.gui/releases/latest)
- Using the Android mobile app https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pocketnet.app

## Account creation
The first time you access Bastyon you should create your own account.

Just click on "Sign in" and follow the instructions.

Note that you can register to Bastyon without sharing your email address. If you add your email address it will only and exclusively be used for newsletters and official communication, but it IS NOT linked with your account. 

Bastyon does not ask for a phone number, either.

## Private Key
Once you create your account, Bastyon generates a Private Key. As the name says, it has to be kept **private**. 
The private key is the only way that you have to login.

No username + password authentication. Just, exclusively, the Private Key. 

### Important notes about the Private Key
- Your private key is unique and must remain private.
- Sign it down or save it in a safe location and do not share it with anyone
- If you lose your Private Key there is NO WAY to restore it. You will be forever locked out of your account. You can create a new account but you will never be able to access the original one.
- The Private Key cannot be changed.
- No one, not even Bastyon's developers and "admins" can access, change, reset your Private Key. We want to stress this out again: if you lose it, you will be forever locked out of your account. There isn't a "Lost you password?" option to restore it.

# How Bastyon is different from other Social Networks
Unlike Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram and the major social networks, Bastyon is not controlled by a central company.

It is instead an Open Source project that runs on distributed nodes. In addition:
- Bastyion does not ask for your email/phone number
- Bastyon does not track your behavior online. No IP is stored, no tracking data is collected
- It offers an encrypted end-to-end built-in chat that is not linked to your email address or phone number (unlike Telegram, Signal, Whatsapp, where your phone number is registered with your account)
- It is based on a blockchain, therefore all the operations are stored on the blockchain (posts, videos, comments, likes...) and cannot be deleted by anyone. 
- It gives freedom of speech to users without banning or limiting them for their political and religious ideas.
- The control is in the hands of users: high reputation users (you earn "reputation points" with likes and comments to your posts/videos) are automatically ranked as "administrators". They are the only ones that can report posts. When several admins report the same post, it becomes hidden. This is similar to what happens on Wikipedia. There isn't a company controlling the contents but a board of admins (on Wikipedia they are elected by all users) that take decisions.
