The base identity server URL for\r\n * identity server requests.\r\n * @param {Function} opts.request Required. The function to invoke for HTTP\r\n * requests. The value of this property is typically <code>require(\"request\")\r\n * </code> as it returns a function which meets the required interface. See\r\n * {@link requestFunction} for more information.\r\n *\r\n * @param {string} opts.accessToken The access_token for this user.\r\n *\r\n * @param {string} opts.userId The user ID for this user.\r\n *\r\n * @param {Object} opts.deviceToImport Device data exported with\r\n *     \"exportDevice\" method that must be imported to recreate this device.\r\n *     Should only be useful for devices with end-to-end crypto enabled.\r\n *     If provided, opts.deviceId and opts.userId should **NOT** be provided\r\n *     (they are present in the exported data).\r\n *\r\n * @param {string} opts.pickleKey Key used to pickle olm objects or other\r\n *     sensitive data.\r\n *\r\n * @param {IdentityServerProvider} [opts.identityServer]\r\n * Optional. A provider object with one function `getAccessToken`, which is a\r\n * callback that returns a Promise<String> of an identity access token to supply\r\n * with identity requests. If the object is unset, no access token will be\r\n * supplied.\r\n * See also https://github.com/vector-im/element-web/issues/10615 which seeks to\r\n * replace the previous approach of manual access tokens params with this\r\n * callback throughout the SDK.\r\n *\r\n * @param {Object=} opts.store\r\n *    The data store used for sync data from the homeserver. If not specified,\r\n *    this client will not store any HTTP responses.

Most data has been\r\n *    migrated out of here to `cryptoStore` instead. If not specified,\r\n *    end-to-end crypto will be disabled. The `createClient` helper\r\n *    _will not_ create this store at the moment.\r\n *\r\n * @param {module:crypto.store.base~CryptoStore} opts.cryptoStore\r\n *    A store to be used for end-to-end crypto session data. If not specified,\r\n *    end-to-end crypto will be disabled. The `createClient` helper will create\r\n *    a default store if needed.\r\n *\r\n * @param {string=} opts.deviceId A unique identifier for this device; used for\r\n *    tracking things like crypto keys and access tokens.  If not specified,\r\n *    end-to-end crypto will be disabled.\r\n *\r\n * @param {Object} opts.scheduler Optional. The scheduler to use.

Extra query parameters to append\r\n * to all requests with this client. Useful for application services which require\r\n * <code>?user_id=</code>.\r\n *\r\n * @param {Number=} opts.localTimeoutMs Optional. The default maximum amount of\r\n * time to wait before timing out HTTP requests. If not specified, there is no timeout.\r\n *\r\n * @param {boolean} [opts.useAuthorizationHeader = false] Set to true to use\r\n * Authorization header instead of query param to send the access token to the server.\r\n *\r\n * @param {boolean} [opts.timelineSupport = false] Set to true to enable\r\n * improved timeline support ({@link\r\n * module:client~MatrixClient#getEventTimeline getEventTimeline}). It is\r\n * disabled by default for compatibility with older clients - in particular to\r\n * maintain support for back-paginating the live timeline after a '/sync'\r\n * result with a gap.\r\n *\r\n * @param {boolean} [opts.unstableClientRelationAggregation = false]\r\n * Optional. Set to true to enable client-side aggregation of event relations\r\n * via `EventTimelineSet#getRelationsForEvent`.\r\n * This feature is currently unstable and the API may change without notice.\r\n *\r\n * @param {Array} [opts.verificationMethods] Optional. The verification method\r\n * that the application can handle.  Each element should be an item from {@link\r\n * module:crypto~verificationMethods verificationMethods}, or a class that\r\n * implements the {$link module:crypto/verification/Base verifier interface}.\r\n *\r\n * @param {boolean} [opts.forceTURN]\r\n * Optional. Whether relaying calls through a TURN server should be forced.\r\n *\r\n * * @param {boolean} [opts.iceCandidatePoolSize]\r\n * Optional. Up to this many ICE candidates will be gathered when an incoming call arrives.\r\n * Gathering does not send data to the caller, but will communicate with the configured TURN\r\n * server. Default 0.\r\n *\r\n * @param {boolean} [opts.supportsCallTransfer]\r\n * Optional. True to advertise support for call transfers to other parties on Matrix calls.\r\n *\r\n * @param {boolean} [opts.fallbackICEServerAllowed]\r\n * Optional. Whether to allow a fallback ICE server should be used for negotiating a\r\n * WebRTC connection if the homeserver doesn't provide any servers. Defaults to false.\r\n *\r\n * @param {boolean} [opts.usingExternalCrypto]\r\n * Optional. Whether to allow sending messages to encrypted rooms when encryption\r\n * is not available internally within this SDK. This is useful if you are using an external\r\n * E2E proxy, for example. Defaults to false.\r\n *\r\n * @param {object} opts.cryptoCallbacks Optional. Callbacks for crypto and cross-signing.\r\n *     The cross-signing API is currently UNSTABLE and may change without notice.\r\n *\r\n * @param {function} [opts.cryptoCallbacks.getCrossSigningKey]\r\n * Optional. Function to call when a cross-signing private key is needed.\r\n * Secure Secret Storage will be used by default if this is unset.\r\n * Args:\r\n *    {string} type The type of key needed.  Will be one of \"master\",\r\n *      \"self_signing\", or \"user_signing\"\r\n *    {Uint8Array} publicKey The public key matching the expected private key.\r\n *        This can be passed to checkPrivateKey() along with the private key\r\n *        in order to check that a given private key matches what is being\r\n *        requested.\r\n *   Should return a promise that resolves with the private key as a\r\n *   UInt8Array or rejects with an error.\r\n *\r\n * @param {function} [opts.cryptoCallbacks.saveCrossSigningKeys]\r\n * Optional. Called when new private keys for cross-signing need to be saved.\r\n * Secure Secret Storage will be used by default if this is unset.\r\n * Args:\r\n *   {object} keys the private keys to save. Map of key name to private key\r\n *       as a UInt8Array. The getPrivateKey callback above will be called\r\n *       with the corresponding key name when the keys are required again.\r\n *\r\n * @param {function} [opts.cryptoCallbacks.shouldUpgradeDeviceVerifications]\r\n * Optional. Called when there are device-to-device verifications that can be\r\n * upgraded into cross-signing verifications.\r\n * Args:\r\n *   {object} users The users whose device verifications can be\r\n *     upgraded to cross-signing verifications.  This will be a map of user IDs\r\n *     to objects with the properties `devices` (array of the user's devices\r\n *     that verified their cross-signing key), and `crossSigningInfo` (the\r\n *     user's cross-signing information)\r\n * Should return a promise which resolves with an array of the user IDs who\r\n * should be cross-signed.\r\n *\r\n * @param {function} [opts.cryptoCallbacks.getSecretStorageKey]\r\n * Optional. Function called when an encryption key for secret storage\r\n *     is required. One or more keys will be described in the keys object.\r\n *     The callback function should return a promise with an array of:\r\n *     [<key name>, <UInt8Array private key>] or null if it cannot provide\r\n *     any of the keys.\r\n * Args:\r\n *   {object} keys Information about the keys:\r\n *       {\r\n *           keys: {\r\n *               <key name>: {\r\n *                   \"algorithm\": \"m.secret_storage.v1.aes-hmac-sha2\",\r\n *                   \"passphrase\": {\r\n *                       \"algorithm\": \"m.pbkdf2\",\r\n *                       \"iterations\": 500000,\r\n *                       \"salt\": \"...\"\r\n *                   },\r\n *                   \"iv\": \"...\",\r\n *                   \"mac\": \"...\"\r\n *               }, ...\r\n *           }\r\n *       }\r\n *   {string} name the name of the value we want to read out of SSSS, for UI purposes.\r\n *\r\n * @param {function} [opts.cryptoCallbacks.cacheSecretStorageKey]\r\n * Optional. Function called when a new encryption key for secret storage\r\n * has been created. This allows the application a chance to cache this key if\r\n * desired to avoid user prompts.\r\n * Args:\r\n *   {string} keyId the ID of the new key\r\n *   {object} keyInfo Infomation about the key as above for `getSecretStorageKey`\r\n *   {Uint8Array} key the new private key\r\n *\r\n * @param {function} [opts.cryptoCallbacks.onSecretRequested]\r\n * Optional.
